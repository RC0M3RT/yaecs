## Project Template

### Use the Github template : TODO UPDATE ME
First, click the green `Use this template` button near the top of this page.
This will take you to Github's ['Generate Repository'](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project/generate) page. 
Fill in a repository name and short description, and click 'Create repository from template'. 
This will allow you to create a new repository in your Github account, 
prepopulated with the contents of this project. 
Now you can clone the project locally and get to work!

    $ git clone https://github.com/<user>/<your_new_repo>.git
